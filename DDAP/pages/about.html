            		As of July 2012, the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs (DDAP), formerly under 
            		the Department of Health, has become a department in its own right. This change reflects 
            		a strong commitment by the Commonwealth to provide education, intervention and treatment 
            		programs to reduce the drug and alcohol abuse and dependency 
					for all Pennsylvanians.
